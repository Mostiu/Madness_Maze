# Madness_Maze
You find yourself in the dank, twisting corridors of an ancient, submerged cave beneath the ocean's depths, near the sunken city of R'lyeh, where Cthulhu lies dreaming. Captured by a cult for a ritual sacrifice to awaken the Great Old One, you must escape before you're forever lost to the madness.
